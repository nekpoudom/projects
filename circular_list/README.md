# Circular-List
Code to find the minimum value in a sorted circular list

This repository contains 3 Python 3.6 programs that find the minimum value in a sorted circular list of integers.
A brief description of the files are as follows:
- minCircList1.py:  Finds the minimum value in the list using the python built in function.  The user is prompted to enter the list.
- minCircList2.py:  Finds the minimum value in the list using the binary search algorithm.  The test lists are included in the program.
- minCircList3.py:  Same as minCircList2.py above but the lists are in an input file listInput.txt and the results are output to a text file.
- listInput.txt:  Input file containing a short list of sorted circular list integers.  Copy to the same directory as the .py files above.
